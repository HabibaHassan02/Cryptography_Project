solution for CTF-2:
1-I have uploaded the packet on an online packet analyzer: https://apackets.com/
2- I analyzed all the requests until I found there was a get request with none argument that I did not know what is this representing, but I saw the same argument in another get request and I found data written in it which seems like a flag because it had {} in it, this was the data: Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}
3- I entered it on a caeser decipher online tool and it gave me the output: The flag is picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef} which is a caeser cipher with 13 shifts
